            Bandung (/ˈbɑːndʊŋ/) is the capital of West Java province in Indonesia. Based on 2015 census, it is Indonesia's fourth most populous city after Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bekasi with over 2.5 million inhabitants. Greater Bandung is the country's second-largest metropolitan with over 8.5 million inhabitants.[2] Located 768 metres (2,520 feet) above sea level, approximately 140 kilometres (87 miles) southeast of Jakarta, Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other Indonesian cities. The city lies on a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provides a natural defence system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.
      </p>
      <p>
            The Dutch first established tea plantations around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital Batavia (180 kilometres (112 miles) to the northwest). The Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (gemeente), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, cafés, and European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed Parijs van Java (Dutch: "The Paris of Java").
      </p>
      <p>
            After Indonesia declared independence in 1945, the city experienced rapid development and urbanisation, transforming it from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km2 (per square kilometre) metropolitan area, and a living space for over 8 million people. New skyscrapers, high-rise buildings, bridges, and gardens have been constructed. Natural resources have been heavily exploited, particularly by conversion of the protected upland area into highland villas and real estate. Although the city has encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods to a complicated traffic system resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), it still attracts large numbers of tourists, weekend sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. The city has won a 2017 regional environmental sustainability award for having the cleanest air among other major cities in ASEAN.[3] The city has also become known as a Smart City, leveraging technology to improve government services, including social media, that alert the authorities to issues such as floods or traffic jams.
      </p>

            The first Asian-African Conference, also known as the Bandung Conference, was hosted in Bandung by President Sukarno in 1955. Redevelopment of the Bandung international airport (BDO) was completed in 2016. To improve infrastructure, the construction of a Jakarta-Bandung High-speed rail started in 2016, with projected completion in 2020, and Bandung Metro Kapsul, a type of indigenous Automated People Mover (APM) is being redefined.[6] The new second airport, Bandung Kertajati International Airport, opened in June 2018.
